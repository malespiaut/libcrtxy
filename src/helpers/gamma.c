/*
  PC monitors are usually uncalibrated and vary between 2.2 and 2.6.
  Macs are calibrated to 1.8 by default.
  Other OSes and hardware will vary.

  Note that with gamma higher than 2.0, 16 bits is technically not
  enough. Very dark screen colors will fold into black. (For sRGB, on the
  other hand, which is close enough to 2.2 gamma, 16 bits is plenty. sRGB
  conversion is more complicated and I won't go into it here.)
